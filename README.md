# BES-Hydro

This is a (3+1)-dimensional diffusive relativistic hydrodynamic code which solves the equations of motion of second-order Denicol-Niemi-Molnar-Rischke (DNMR) theory, including bulk and shear viscous currents and baryon diffusion currents.

Instructions on how to use the code can be found in the `BEShydroUserManual.pdf`. Physics and design of the code can be found in the following references:
