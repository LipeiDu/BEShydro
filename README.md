# BEShydro

**BEShydro** is a (3+1)-dimensional diffusive relativistic hydrodynamic code which solves the equations of motion of second-order Denicol-Niemi-Molnar-Rischke (DNMR) theory, including bulk and shear viscous currents and baryon diffusion currents.

Instructions on how to use the code can be found in the `BEShydro_User_Manual.pdf`. Physics and design of the code can be found in the user manual and the following references:
